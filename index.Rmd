# Introduction {-}

Note that this resource is still a work in progress. You can write to me at: marion.prat@bristol.ac.uk.

In this tutorial, we will show how to extract useful empirical facts about long-run growth from the Penn World Table (PWT) using basic functions and operations in Excel. The PWT 10.01 contains data on GDP and its components, as well as demographic characteristics for 183 countries from 1950 to 2019 (although for some countries the data may not be available as early as 1950). 

**Download** the PWT 10.01 Excel spreadsheet <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">**here**</span></a> and **save** it in a folder entitled PWT. The spreadsheet contains three sheets: "Info", "Legend" and "Data".

```{r ExcelPWT, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT.png"))

```

Before going any further, check the definition of the variables in the "Legend" sheet. Why are there so many different measures of real GDP? How do they differ?

```{r ExcelPWT_legend, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT_legend.png"))

```

The "Data" sheet contains the dataset.

```{r ExcelPWT_data, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT_data.png"))

```

Each row corresponds to observations for a given country in a given year and each column represents a variable. Although this layout may appear confusing at first, it is in fact computer friendly: 

- First, it is easy to use a *Power Query* in the *Data* tab (accessed via "Get Data") to create a new Excel sheet on any subset of the data you are interested in analysing. This is what we are going to do in this tutorial.
- Second, it is compatible with how statistical software such as R work as they store variables in column vectors. 


# Preparing the dataset

## Extracting the relevant information

Assume we are only interested in working with the variables "year", "rgdpo" and "pop" for the United Kingdom. It will be useful to create a new spreadsheet containing only the data needed for this analysis. We present two methods that can be employed to extract the relevant data from the main spreadsheet.   

**Method 1: Brute force method**

- Click on the arrow next to "country" (Column B) and select the country of your choice (here the United Kingdom). *Tip*: first click on *Select all* to unselect all countries.

```{r ExcelPWT1, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", out.height="65%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT1.png"))

```

- To select the rows containing UK data, click on the first row and on the last row in the range while pressing the shift key at the same time. 

- Create a new spreadsheet, rename it "United Kingdom" and paste the data. Delete all the columns that are not needed.

- Go to *Insert* and click on *Table*. In the "Create Table" box, select "My table has headers" and click *OK*.

```{r ExcelPWT2, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT2.png"))

```

- The following table should appear.

```{r ExcelPWT2b, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT2b.png"))

```

**Method 2: Smart method (more likely to avoid mistakes)**

- Go to *Data*, and click on *Get Data*

```{r ExcelPWT3, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT3.png"))

```

- Select *From File*, then *From Excel Workbook*

```{r ExcelPWT4, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT4.png"))

```

- Select **pwt1001** (in the folder where you saved it) and click on *Import*. In the *Navigator* box, select the *Data* spreadsheet and press *Transform Data*

```{r ExcelPWT5, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT5.png"))

```

- In the *Data - Power Query Editor* box, press the arrow next to *country* and select *United Kingdom* 

```{r ExcelPWT6, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT6.png"))

```

- Press the arrow next to *Choose Columns* and select *year*, *rgdpo* and *pop*

```{r ExcelPWT7, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT7.png"))

```

- In the *Properties* on the right, write the name of the new spreadsheet ("United Kingdom"). 

```{r ExcelPWT8a, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT8a.png"))

```

- Then click on *Close & Load* to create the new spreadsheet

```{r ExcelPWT8b, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT8b.png"))

```

- The new spreadsheet "United Kingdom" contains a table with three columns corresponding to "year", "rgdpo" and "pop"

```{r ExcelPWT9, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT9.png"))

```


## Freezing panes

To freeze the top row, go to *View*, then *Freeze pane* and select *Freeze Top Row*.

```{r ExcelPWT10, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT10.png"))

```

The top row remains visible while scrolling through the rest of the worksheet. Similarly it is possible to freeze the first column.

## Hiding rows or columns

- To show data for selected years only, for example the first and the last (1950 and 2019), click on the arrow next to *year* and select "1950" and "2019", then click *OK*.

```{r ExcelPWT11, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT11.png"))

```

Only the first and last observations appear!

```{r ExcelPWT12, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT12.png"))

```

- To hide a column (or a row), right click on its letter (or number) header (eg "C") and select *hide*. Select *unhide* to reverse this action.

```{r ExcelPWT13, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT13.png"))

```

## Sorting observations

<span style="color: blue;">**Practice question**</span>: create a new spreadsheet entitled "1970" containing the three entries "country", "rgdpo" and "pop" for the year 1970. 

In the "1970" spreadsheet, countries by default are listed in alphabetical order. To sort the countries from the wealthiest to the poorest in terms of GDP, click on the arrow next to "rgdpo" and select "Sort Largest to smallest" to rearrange the countries in descending values of GDP.

```{r ExcelPWT14, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT14.png"))

```


# Calculations in Excel

## Basic arithmetic calculations

A *formula* in Excel always starts with an equal sign =

*Arithmetic operators*: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ (exponentiation). 

- **Example 1**: to calculate "$3 + 2 \times 4 + 6^2$" in Excel, select a cell, type:
```{r ExcelPWT15, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15.png"))

```
and press "Enter".

- **Example 2**: to calculate "$3 \times (3+8) + \frac{2}{3+1} + 6^{1/2}$" in Excel, select a cell, type:
```{r ExcelPWT15b, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15b.png"))

```
and  press "Enter".

## Excel built-in functions

For more complex operations, it will be more convenient to use the Excel built-in functions. 

To let Excel help you find the relevant function and use it, select a cell and write an equal sign. In the top left corner, a drop-down menu appears with a list of the most commonly used formulas. If the function you are looking for does not appear here, go to "More Functions" at the bottom of the menu. A search box will prompt you to describe the function you are interested in.

```{r ExcelPWT16, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT16.png"))

```

**Example**: the function "AVERAGE" calculates the average of two or several numbers. To calculate the average of 6 and 4, enter 4 and 6 in the "Function Arguments" box or write directly "=AVERAGE(6,4)".

```{r ExcelPWT17, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT17.png"))

```

## Write formulas referring to values in other cells

In Excel, columns are indexed by letters and rows by numbers. Each cell therefore can be referenced by their column letter and row number. For example, "A3", "C1", "F6". 

- **Example 1**: to calculate "$3 + 2 \times 4 + 6^2$", it is possible to enter separately the values 3, 2, 4 and 6 into separate cells and then write a formula to perform this operation referring to the corresponding cells as follows: 
```{r ExcelPWT15c, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15c.png"))

```
where "A2" is 3, "B2" is 2, "C2" is 4 and "D2" is 6. 

- **Example 2**: to calculate the average of the four numbers used in the previous example using the AVERAGE() function, select the cells comprising the range of values you want to include in the calculation:
```{r ExcelPWT15d, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15d.png"))

```

# Creating new variables

## Generating a new GDP per capita series

- Using the data on GDP and population for the United Kingdom in the "United Kingdom" sheet we can generate a series of values for UK GDP per capita. For this, we need to create a formula referring to values in other cells.

- To calculate UK GDP per capita in 1950 we need to divide UK output ("rgdpo") by UK population ("pop"). Select the cell where you want the result to appear (eg "D2"). The relevant formula for GDP per capita in 1950 is "=B2/C2". "B2" is UK GDP in 1950, "C2" is UK population in 1950 and "/" indicates that you are dividing the former by the latter. Instead of writing "B2" and "C2" you may just click on the corresponding cells.

```{r ExcelPWT18, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT18.png"))

```

- To calculate UK GDP per capita in all subsequent years, we need to apply the same formula to all rows ( representing years) in the dataset. 
- To do this you can either copy and paste the formula in all subsequent cells in the D column or double click on the "+" in the bottom right corner of D2, or click on the "+" and drag it over all the subsequent cells in the D column (whatever works for you!). 

```{r ExcelPWT19, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT19.png"))

```

- If the data is presented in a table (as below), the formula in "D2" will apply automatically to all rows in column D.

```{r ExcelPWT20, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT20.png"))

```

## Calculating growth rates

Using the UK GDP per capita series, we can now create the series of annual growth rates of GDP per capita using the formula $g_y = \frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}} -1$. For example, the annual growth rate of UK GDP per capita in 1951 is equal to the ratio of GDP per capita in 1951 ("D3") and in 1950 ("D2") minus 1. 

```{r ExcelPWT21, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21.png"))

```

Then copy the formula in all subsequent cells to generate the whole series of annual growth rates.


## Generating a series for the logarithm of a variable

To calculate a series for the natural logarithm of UK GDP per capita, use the LN() function:
 
```{r ExcelPWT21b, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21b.png"))


```

Then copy the formula in all subsequent cells to generate the whole series of annual growth rates. 
*Important*: to calculate the natural logarithm, do not use the LOG() function, which should only be used if you want to calculate the logarithm with a different base!


# Formatting numbers

```{r ExcelPWT22, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT22.png"))

```

The data in the table above contains numbers with various decimal points and the GDP growth rate in column E is expressed in decimal points. It is possible to make the data more presentable by using the "Number" options in the top ribbon (first select the "Home" tab).

- To express the annual growth rate in % instead of decimal points, select column D and click on the "%" icon. 

```{r ExcelPWT23, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT23.png"))

```

- The same number is now expressed in %. However, the growth rate have been rounded to the nearest integer value. It might be useful to to have a more precise number displayed. To increase the number of decimal points, click on the icon indicated by the red arrow below as many time as you want to add decimal points.

```{r ExcelPWT25, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT25.png"))

```

- The variables "rgdpo" and "GDPPC" are large numbers expressed in millions of $, which may be easier to read by having a comma separate the 1000s. This can be done by selecting the columns on which you want to apply this change and clicking on the comma icon.

```{r ExcelPWT28, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT28.png"))

```

The resulting table is easier to read.  

```{r ExcelPWT29, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT29.png"))

```


# Create plots

## Create a line chart

To create a plot of the logarithm of UK GDP, select the "year" and "lnGDPPC" column, go to "Insert" and click on "Recommended charts". Select the plot which has "year" on x-axis and "lnGDPPC" on the y-axis among the options proposed. 

<video src="media/video1.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

**Note**: you may be tempted to select fancy layouts using the "Quick Layout" tab. Although it may be helpful in some cases, it is more likely to add unnecessary detail and therefore be more confusing to read. Better to invest in learning the chart elements can be modified to serve the purpose of each individual graph.

## Log scale

TBA

## Titles

To add or remove a char title, click on the chart and go to "Chart Design", then "Add Chart Element". 

- Select "Chart title" to add or remove a plot title.  
- Select "Axis Titles" to add titles to the horizontal and vertical axis.

<video src="media/video2.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>


**Note**: depending on the plot, adding titles may not add much information. For example, in the case of the plot of the logarithm of UK GDP per capita, adding axis titles do not add much information as it is clear already that the horizontal axis represents dates and the plot title already explains what it represents. In other cases, it may be impossible to understand what is represented without axis titles. 

## Format axes

Formatting axes properly may go a long way to produce a graph that is informative and immediately understandable. 

- To format the horizontal axis: right click on the dates on the chart and select "Format axis". To have the dates displayed only every 10 years, use the "Label" option.
- To format the vertical axis: right click on the vertical axis and select "Format axis". To modify the range of the vertical axis so that it better fits the range in the data, change the minimum or the maximum in the "Bounds" tab. To reduce/increase the number of ticks, change "Major" in the "Units tab. To reduce the number of decimal points, go to the "Number" option and specify your preferred number of decimal points (eg 1). 

<video src="media/video3.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

## Add trend lines

To add a trend line, click on the chart and go to "Chart Design" and "Add Chart Element". Then go to "Trendline" and select the shape of trend line that is the most relevant for your plot (here a linear trend because we plot the logarithm of GDP). 

<video src="media/video4.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

## Format chart area

Finally, altering the appearance of the line plot may improve the clarity of the graph. You may alter the thickness, the colour and the pattern of the line plot. To do so click on the line you wish to apply these changes to and select your preferred options. 

<video src="media/video5.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

## Export plot to Word document

<video src="media/video6.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

**Note**: if you do not paste the plot as a picture in the Word document, it is the entire Excel sheet that you are including into your Word document. Pasting the document as a picture (as in the video) may be more efficient.

# Tables

We now want to calculate the trend growth rate of UK GDP per capita between 1950 and 2019 using our data from the Penn World Tables. In addition to the trend growth over the full sample period, we would like to calculate it over three subperiods that we have identified using the plot of the logarithm of GDP per capita: 1950-1990, 1990-2008 and 2008-2019. Finally we would like to present the results in a table in a Word document.

## Calculate compound growth rates in Excel

To calculate the trend growth rate we use the compound growth rate formula: $g = \left(\frac{y_{end}}{y_{start}}\right)^{\frac{1}{end-start}}-1$ (multiplied by 100 to express the growth rate in %)

In this video, it is shown how to wrap text within a cell, how to center numbers (or text) within a cell, how to alter the background colour of the cells and how to add borders. 

<video src="media/video8.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>

The table is now ready to be exported into a Word document.

# AI Large language models in Excel

Many AI tools are embedded into Excel. We have already used some of these features in previous chapters:

- When you create a new variable in a new column using a formula, Excel will use it as an example to write the formula in all subsequent rows in the same column and automatically update as the data changes ("Formula by Example"). 
- When creating a chart, Excel proposes a selection of charts that are the most likely to be relevant in "Recommended charts".

With the incorporation of Microsoft Copilot within Excel, the capabilities of AI tools in Excel is likely to increase.

## Using GPTs to find an Excel function

If you do not know how to write a formula in Excel, you may ask an AI tool to suggest a formula.

<span style="color: blue;">**Practice question**</span>: 

- Type the following prompt in your favorite AI language model (Open AI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, ...): "Write a formula to calculate the compounded annual growth rate of GDP in Excel". 
- Can you use the formula in Excel to calculate the compound annual growth rate of UK GDP per capita? Be careful that the GPT may be "hallucinating" an Excel function.

# Using AI tools with Excel

In this chapter, we will present how Large Language Models (LLM) can be used to 1) write VBA code to perform tasks in Excel and 2) perform tasks directly in Excel using Microsoft Copilot.

The key messages are:

1. There is a code behind every task performed in Excel and AI tools work by transforming prompts into code.
2. Whether you are asking AI tools to write code or to perform a task directly, the main difficulty is to write a prompt that will get the desired task done.

This chapter was written in March 2024. By the time you read this, AI tools might have become more efficient at performing the tasks asked of them here.

## What are Large Language Model (LLM)?

Go to [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and write the following prompts: 

`Explain what is Microsoft Copilot / ChatGPT / Large language models`

`Explain what is Excel VBA`

## What is Excel VBA?

VBA stands for **Visual Basic for Applications**. It is a programming tool that can be used to perform operations in Excel (and other office programs). Most operations performed in Excel can be programmed in VBA instead of being performed manually as we have done in the previous chapters. It is mostly useful when you have to do repetitive tasks, in which case it may be convenient to automate them using code, which can be saved and reused at a later stage. 

An important drawback of using Excel as we have done so far is that is that the tasks we have performed are not easily reproducible. You can save the results for later information but may not remember what tasks were performed to arrive at these results. 

However, it does not mean that coding in Excel VBA is the appropriate method to use at all times! It will soon be possible to ask Microsoft Copilot to perform simple tasks in Excel. The next section shows you what is happening behind the scene when you are asking Copilot to perform simple tasks in Excel.
