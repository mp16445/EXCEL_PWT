# Introduction {-}

*This resource is still a work in progress. Any feedback is welcome.* 

*You can write to me at: marion.prat@bristol.ac.uk.*

In this tutorial, we will show how to extract useful empirical facts about long-run growth from the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/" target="_blank"><span style="color: black;">**Penn World Table**</span></a> [@PWT] using basic functions and operations in Excel. The PWT 11.0 contains data on GDP and its components, as well as demographic characteristics for 185 countries from 1950 to 2023 (although for some countries the data may not be available as early as 1950). 

**Download** the PWT PWT 11.0 Excel spreadsheet <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">**here**</span></a> and **save** it in a folder entitled PWT. The spreadsheet contains three sheets: "Info", "Legend" and "Data".

```{r ExcelPWT, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT.png"))

```

Before going any further, check the definition of the variables in the "Legend" sheet. Why are there so many different measures of real GDP? How do they differ?

```{r ExcelPWT_legend, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT_legend.png"))

```

The "Data" sheet contains the dataset.

```{r ExcelPWT_data, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT_data.png"))

```

Each row corresponds to observations for a given country in a given year and each column represents a variable. Although this layout may appear confusing at first, it is in fact computer friendly: 

- First, it is easy to use a *Power Query* in the *Data* tab (accessed via "Get Data") to create a new Excel sheet containing any subset of the data you are interested in analysing. This is what we are going to do in this tutorial.
- Second, it is compatible with how statistical software (such as R or Python) work as they store variables in column vectors. 


# Preparing the dataset

## Extracting the relevant information

Assume we are only interested in working with the variables "year", "rgdpo" and "pop" for the United Kingdom. It will be useful to create a new spreadsheet containing only the data needed for this analysis. We present two methods that can be employed to extract the relevant data from the main spreadsheet.   

**Method 1: Brute force method**

- Click on the arrow next to "country" (Column B) and select the country of your choice (here the United Kingdom). *Tip*: first click on *Select all* to unselect all countries.

```{r ExcelPWT1, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", out.height="65%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT1.png"))

```

- To select the rows containing UK data, click on the first row and on the last row in the range while pressing the shift key at the same time. 

- Create a new spreadsheet, rename it "United Kingdom" and paste the data. Delete all the columns that are not needed.

- Go to *Insert* and click on *Table*. In the "Create Table" box, select "My table has headers" and click *OK*.

```{r ExcelPWT2, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT2.png"))

```

- The following table should appear.

```{r ExcelPWT2b, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT2b.png"))

```

**Method 2: Smart method (more likely to avoid mistakes)**

- Go to *Data*, and click on *Get Data*

```{r ExcelPWT3, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT3.png"))

```

- Select *From File*, then *From Excel Workbook*

```{r ExcelPWT4, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT4.png"))

```

- Select **pwt110** (in the folder where you saved it) and click on *Import*. In the *Navigator* box, select the *Data* spreadsheet and press *Transform Data*

```{r ExcelPWT5, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT5.png"))

```

- In the *Data - Power Query Editor* box, press the arrow next to *country* and select *United Kingdom* 

```{r ExcelPWT6, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT6.png"))

```

- Press the arrow next to *Choose Columns* and select *year*, *rgdpo* and *pop*

```{r ExcelPWT7, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT7.png"))

```

- In the *Properties* on the right, write the name of the new spreadsheet ("United Kingdom"). 

```{r ExcelPWT8a, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT8a.png"))

```

- Then click on *Close & Load* to create the new spreadsheet

```{r ExcelPWT8b, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT8b.png"))

```

- The new spreadsheet "United Kingdom" contains a table with three columns corresponding to "year", "rgdpo" and "pop"

```{r ExcelPWT9, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT9.png"))

```

<span style="color: blue;">**Practice exercise**</span>: create a new spreadsheet entitled "1970" containing the three entries "country", "rgdpo" and "pop" for the year 1970. 

## Freezing panes

To freeze the top row, go to *View*, then *Freeze pane* and select *Freeze Top Row*.

```{r ExcelPWT10, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT10.png"))

```

The top row remains visible while scrolling through the rest of the worksheet. Similarly it is possible to freeze the first column.

## Hiding rows or columns

- To show data for selected years only, for example the first and the last (1950 and 2019), click on the arrow next to *year* and select "1950" and "2019", then click *OK*.

```{r ExcelPWT11, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT11.png"))

```

Only the first and last observations appear!

```{r ExcelPWT12, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT12.png"))

```

- To hide a column (or a row), right click on its letter (or number) header (eg "C") and select *hide*. Select *unhide* to reverse this action.

```{r ExcelPWT13, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT13.png"))

```

## Sorting observations

In the "1970" spreadsheet (*See Practice exercise in Section 1.1*), countries by default are listed in alphabetical order. To sort the countries from the wealthiest to the poorest in terms of GDP, click on the arrow next to "rgdpo" and select "Sort Largest to smallest" to rearrange the countries in descending values of GDP.

```{r ExcelPWT14, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT14.png"))

```


# Calculations in Excel

## Basic arithmetic calculations

A *formula* in Excel always starts with an equal sign =

*Arithmetic operators*: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ (exponentiation). 

- **Example 1**: to calculate "$3 + 2 \times 4 + 6^2$" in Excel, select a cell, type:
```{r ExcelPWT15, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15.png"))

```
and press "Enter".

- **Example 2**: to calculate "$3 \times (3+8) + \frac{2}{3+1} + 6^{1/2}$" in Excel, select a cell, type:
```{r ExcelPWT15b, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15b.png"))

```
and  press "Enter".

## Excel built-in functions

For more complex operations, it will be more convenient to use the Excel built-in functions. 

To let Excel help you find the relevant function and use it, select a cell and write an equal sign. In the top left corner, a drop-down menu appears with a list of the most commonly used formulas. If the function you are looking for does not appear here, go to "More Functions" at the bottom of the menu. A search box will prompt you to describe the function you are interested in.

```{r ExcelPWT16, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT16.png"))

```

**Example**: the function "AVERAGE" calculates the average of two or several numbers. To calculate the average of 6 and 4, enter 4 and 6 in the "Function Arguments" box or write directly "=AVERAGE(6,4)".

```{r ExcelPWT17, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT17.png"))

```

## Write formulas referring to values in other cells

In Excel, columns are indexed by letters and rows by numbers. Each cell therefore can be referenced by their column letter and row number. For example, "A3", "C1", "F6". 

- **Example 1**: to calculate "$3 + 2 \times 4 + 6^2$", it is possible to enter separately the values 3, 2, 4 and 6 into separate cells and then write a formula to perform this operation referring to the corresponding cells as follows: 
```{r ExcelPWT15c, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15c.png"))

```
where "A2" is 3, "B2" is 2, "C2" is 4 and "D2" is 6. 

- **Example 2**: to calculate the average of the four numbers used in the previous example using the AVERAGE() function, select the cells comprising the range of values you want to include in the calculation:
```{r ExcelPWT15d, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", out.height="70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT15d.png"))

```

# Creating new variables

## Generating new variables

- Using the data on GDP and population for the United Kingdom in the "United Kingdom" sheet we can generate a series of values for UK GDP per capita. For this, we need to create a formula referring to values in other cells.

- To calculate UK GDP per capita in 1950 we need to divide UK output ("rgdpo") by UK population ("pop"). Select the cell where you want the result to appear (eg "D2"). The relevant formula for GDP per capita in 1950 is "=B2/C2". "B2" is UK GDP in 1950, "C2" is UK population in 1950 and "/" indicates that you are dividing the former by the latter. Instead of writing "B2" and "C2" you may just click on the corresponding cells.

```{r ExcelPWT18, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT18.png"))

```

- To calculate UK GDP per capita in all subsequent years, we need to apply the same formula to all rows (representing years) in the dataset. 
- To do this you can either copy and paste the formula in all subsequent cells in the D column or double click on the "+" in the bottom right corner of D2, or click on the "+" and drag it over all the subsequent cells in the D column (whatever works for you!). 

```{r ExcelPWT19, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT19.png"))

```

- If the data is presented in a table (as below), the formula in "D2" will apply automatically to all rows in column D.

```{r ExcelPWT20, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT20.png"))

```

## Calculating growth rates

Using the UK GDP per capita series, we can now create the series of annual growth rates of GDP per capita using the discrete time formula $g_y = \frac{y_t}{y_{t-1}} -1$. For example, the annual growth rate of UK GDP per capita in 1951 is equal to the ratio of GDP per capita in 1951 ("D3") and in 1950 ("D2") minus 1. 

```{r ExcelPWT21, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21.png"))

```

Then copy the formula in all subsequent cells to generate the whole series of annual growth rates.


## Using the natural logarithm function

To calculate a series for the natural logarithm of UK GDP per capita, use the LN() function:
 
```{r ExcelPWT21b, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21b.png"))


```

Then copy the formula in all subsequent cells to generate the natural logarithm of GDP in all subsequent years. 
*Important*: to calculate the natural logarithm, do not use the LOG() function, which should only be used if you want to calculate the logarithm with a different base!

Using the natural logarithm function, we can calculate the annual growth rate using the continuous time formula: $g_y = ln(y_t) - ln(y_{t-1})$. For example, the annual growth rate of UK GDP per capita in 1951 is equal to the natural logarithm of GDP per capita in 1951 minus the natural logarithm of GDP per capita in 1950.

```{r ExcelPWT21c, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21c.png"))

```

Then copy the formula in all subsequent cells to generate the whole series of annual growth rates. Compare it with the growth rate calculated using the discrete time formula:

```{r ExcelPWT21d, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT21d.png"))

```

The two formulas yield similar (to 2 decimal points) but not perfectly identical estimates of the annual growth rates.  

# Formatting numbers

```{r ExcelPWT22, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT22.png"))

```

The data in the table above contains numbers with various decimal points and the GDP growth rate in column E is expressed in fractional form. It is possible to make the data more presentable by using the "Number" options in the top ribbon (first select the "Home" tab).

- To express the annual growth rate in % instead of decimal points, select column D and click on the "%" icon. 

```{r ExcelPWT23, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT23.png"))

```

- The same number is now expressed in %. However, the growth rate have been rounded to the nearest integer value. It might be useful to display a more precise number. To increase the number of decimal points, click on the  $\leftarrow.000$ icon indicated by the red arrow below as many time as you want to add decimal points.

```{r ExcelPWT25, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT25.png"))

```

- To reduce the number of decimal points (for example for the "pop" variable), click on the $\rightarrow.000$ icon instead.

- The variables "rgdpo" and "GDPPC" are large numbers expressed in millions of $, which may be easier to read by having a comma separate the 1000s. This can be done by selecting the columns on which you want to apply this change and clicking on the comma icon.

```{r ExcelPWT28, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT28.png"))

```

The resulting table is easier to read.  

```{r ExcelPWT29, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ExcelPWT29.png"))

```


# Create plots

## Create a line chart

To create a plot of the logarithm of UK GDP, select the "year" and "lnGDPPC" column, go to "Insert" and click on "Recommended charts". Select the plot which has "year" on x-axis and "lnGDPPC" on the y-axis among the options proposed. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video1.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

**Note**: you may be tempted to select fancy layouts using the "Quick Layout" tab. Although it may be helpful in some cases, it is more likely to add unnecessary detail and therefore be more confusing to read. Better to invest in learning how the chart elements can be modified to serve the purpose of each individual graph.

## Titles

To add or remove a char title, click on the chart and go to "Chart Design", then "Add Chart Element". 

- Select "Chart title" to add or remove a plot title.  
- Select "Axis Titles" to add titles to the horizontal and vertical axis.

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video2.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

**Note**: depending on the plot, adding titles may not add much information. For example, in the case of the plot of the logarithm of UK GDP per capita, adding axis titles do not add much information as it is clear already that the horizontal axis represents dates and the plot title already explains what it represents. In other cases, it may be impossible to understand what is represented without axis titles. 

## Format axes

Formatting axes properly may go a long way to produce a graph that is informative and immediately understandable. 

- To format the horizontal axis: right click on the dates on the chart and select "Format axis". To have the dates displayed only every 10 years, use the "Label" option.
- To format the vertical axis: right click on the vertical axis and select "Format axis". To modify the range of the vertical axis so that it better fits the range in the data, change the minimum or the maximum in the "Bounds" tab. To reduce/increase the number of ticks, change "Major" in the "Units tab. To reduce the number of decimal points, go to the "Number" option and specify your preferred number of decimal points (eg 1). 

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video3.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

## Logarithimc (ratio) scale

Instead of plotting the logarithm of GDP per capita, you may want to represent GDP per capita on a ratio scale. Here is how the "Format axis" panel can be used to plot the logarithm base 2 of GDP per capita, so that each tick mark represents a doubling of GDP per capita.

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video10.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>


## Add trend lines

To add a trend line, click on the chart and go to "Chart Design" and "Add Chart Element". Then go to "Trendline" and select the shape of trend line that is the most relevant for your plot (here a linear trend because we plot the logarithm of GDP). 

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video4.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

## Format chart area

Finally, altering the appearance of the line plot may improve the clarity of the graph. You may alter the thickness, the colour and the pattern of the line plot. To do so click on the line you wish to apply these changes to and select your preferred options. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video5.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>


## Export plot to Word document

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video6.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

**Note**: if you do not paste the plot as a picture in the Word document, it is the entire Excel sheet that you are including into your Word document. Pasting the document as a picture (as in the video) may be more efficient.

# Tables

We now want to calculate the trend growth rate of UK GDP per capita between 1950 and 2019 using our data from the Penn World Tables. In addition to the trend growth over the full sample period, we would like to calculate it over three subperiods that we have identified using the plot of the logarithm of GDP per capita: 1950-1990, 1990-2008 and 2008-2019. Finally we would like to present the results in a table in a Word document.

## Calculate compound growth rates in Excel

To calculate the compound average growth rate between time $t$ and time $s$, we use the compound growth rate formula: $g_{y,t-s} = \left(\frac{y_{s}}{y_{t}}\right)^{\frac{1}{s-t}}-1$ (multiplied by 100 to express the growth rate in %).

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video7.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

*Alternatively you may use the formula using the logarithmic approximation to calculate compound annual growth rates: $g_{y,t-s} = \frac{1}{s-t}(\ln{y_s}-\ln{y_t})$ (multiplied by 100 to express the growth rate in %).* 

## Formatting tables in Excel

In this video, it is shown how to wrap text within a cell, how to center numbers (or text) within a cell, how to alter the background colour of the cells and how to add borders. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <video src="media/video8.mp4" width="700" height="540" controls></video>
</div>

The table is now ready to be exported into a Word document.

# Growth accounting

This section will guide you through the construction of an Excel spreadsheet and the calculation of the growth accounting decomposition of UK GDP ($Y$). 

## Growth accounting equation

**Cobb-Douglas production function**:
$$Y_t = A_tK_t^\beta L_t^{1-\beta}$$
where 

- $Y$ is total output
- $A$ is total factor productivity 
- $K$ is the capital stock 
- $L$ is the number of hours worked
- $\beta$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital (elasticity of capital).

**Growth accounting equation**:
$$g_Y = g_A + \beta g_K + (1-\beta)g_L  $$
where

- We will assume an elasticity of output with respect to capital equal to 0.3 (unless otherwise stated).
- We will estimate $g_Y$, $g_K$ and $g_L$ using the following data in the *Penn World Tables*.

```{r GA_data_def, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%", out.height="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/GA_data_def.png"))

```

- $g_A$ is not directly observable but can be estimated as the residual of the growth accounting equation:
  $$g_A = g_Y - \beta g_K - (1-\beta)g_L $$
  *Note that the PWT database does contain an estimated series of TFP (denoted "ctfp" and "rtfpna"), but we will ignore them for the purpose of this exercise, which is to understand how such a series can be constructed using National Accounts data.*

## Variable selection and transformation

- Extract the relevant variables in a new sheet:

```{r UK_GA_data, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA.png"))

```

- **Construct the total number of hours worked ("hours")** by multiplying the number of persons engaged (in millions) ("emp") by the average number of hours worked per persons engaged ("avh"). This will be the labour input variable ("L"). 

```{r UK_GA_data_L, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_L.png"))

```


## Results: annual decompositions

In this section, we will construct the growth rate of total factor productivity, $g_A$, decompose the growth rate of GDP, $g_Y$, into the contribution of capital accumulation, $\beta g_K$, the contribution of hours worked, $(1-\beta)g_L$, and the contribution of TFP growth, $g_A$, and show how to present the results effectively.

- **Calculate the annual growth rate of output, the capital stock and hours worked** using the formula for the growth rate of variable $x$: $g_{x,t} = \frac{x_t}{x_{t-1}} - 1$ (*see* section 3.2 for how to calculate growth rates). 

```{r UK_GA_annual_growth_rates, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_agr.png"))

```

*Alternatively you may use the formula using the logarithmic approximation to calculate growth rates (see Section 3.3.).* 

- **Calculate the TFP growth rate** ($g_A$) as the residual of the growth accounting equation: 
$$g_A = g_Y - 0.3g_K - 0.7g_L$$
```{r UK_GA_annual_ga, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_aga.png"))

```

- **Calculate the contribution of each factor to the growth of output**:
  - capital accumulation: $\beta g_K = 0.3g_K$ 
  - hours worked: $(1-\beta)g_L = 0.7g_L$

```{r UK_GA_annual_decomp, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_a_decomp.png"))

```

- **Plot the results** (*see* Section 5 for how to create and format a line plot)

```{r UK_GA_Y_decomp_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_Y_decomp_plot.png"))

```

## Results: average decompositions

Sometimes, it will be informative to decompose the average growth rates of output over long periods of time (decades), removing the effects of short-run fluctuations and allowing the analysis to focus on long-run trends. 

- **Identify meaningful subperiods** either using a plot of the natural logarithm to identify turning points in the growth experience of a country or based on significant country specific events (eg the fall of the Berlin wall and the reunification in Germany in 1990) or based on significant world events (eg the slowdown in productivity growth in developed economies in the early 1970s). In this example, we will decompose the growth of UK output over the full sample period (1950-2019) and over 3 subperiods (1950-1973, 1973-2007, 2007-2019).

- **Select the data by hiding the irrelevant rows**:

```{r UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_period, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_data.png"))

```

- **Calculate the average growth rate of output, capital and labour over the full sample period and each subperiod** using the formula for the compound average growth rate of variable $x$: $g_{x,t-s} = \left(\frac{x_s}{x_{t}}\right)^{\frac{1}{s-t}} - 1$ or its logarithmic approximation (*see* section 6.1 for how to calculate compound annual growth rates).

```{r UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_growth_rates, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_growth_rates.png"))

```

- **Calculate average growth rates of TFP and the contributions of capital and labour to the growth of output** using the growth accounting equation. 

```{r UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_table, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_table.png"))

```

- **Present the results** in a table, a column chart or any other chart you find useful to convey the information. 

```{r UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_results, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/UK_GA_Y_decomp_full_results.png"))

# Excel and Large language models

Many AI tools are already embedded into Excel. We have already used some of these features in previous chapters:

- When you create a new variable in a new column using a formula, Excel will use it as an example to write the formula in all subsequent rows in the same column and automatically update as the data changes ("Formula by Example"). 
- When creating a chart, Excel proposes a selection of charts likely to be relevant in "Recommended charts".

With the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Microsoft Copilot within Excel, the capabilities of generative AI tools in Excel is likely to increase. In this section, we explore what these new capabilities may look like. It is strongly recommended that you perform all calculations using Excel or other programming software rather than ask an LLM to generate output for you.   

*All output in this section have been generated using ChatGPT5.2.*

## Find an Excel formula

If you do not know how to write a formula in Excel, you may ask a LLM to suggest a formula.

<span style="color: blue;">**Example: formula for the compound annual growth rate**</span>: 

> **Prompt (ChatGPT 5.2)**: 
I have annual GDP data spanning the period 1950 to 2023. Write an Excel formula I can use to calculate the compounded annual growth rate of GDP between 1950 and 2023. Explain carefully the formula.

ChatGPT 5.2 offers the following reply:

```{r CGPT5.2_CAGR, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_CAGR.png"))

```

<span style="color: blue;">**Check**</span>: 

- Is the formula correct? 
- Can you use the formula in Excel to calculate the compound annual growth rate of UK GDP per capita? 
- Be careful that large language models may be "hallucinating" an Excel function.


## Perform operations on data  

Large language models can also be used to perform most of the tasks discussed in the previous sections. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Example: Extract UK data and create GDP per capita**</span>:

> **Prompt (ChatGPT 5.2)**: (attaching pwt110.xlsx) Using the PWT11.0 dataset attached, do the following tasks. 1) Extract “year”, “rgdpo” and “pop” for entries where “country” is equal to “United Kingdom”. 2) Construct the new variable for UK GDP per capita using the variables extracted. 3) Create a new Excel spreadsheet including the new variable, and including all intermediate steps ready to be downloaded.

ChatGPT 5.2 generates:

1. Python code used to extract the relevant data and create the new variable.

2. Output: new Excel spreadsheet

```{r CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", out.height="85%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC.png"))

```

Opening the new spreadsheet:

```{r CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC_data.png"))

```

<span style="color: blue;">**Check**</span>: 

- Compare this spreadsheet with that created in Section 1.1. 
- Check that the first entry for UK GDP per capita is correct.  

ChatGPT 5.2 provides this additional information:

```{r CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC_notes, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_UKGDPPC_v2.png"))

```

<span style="color: blue;">**Check**</span> that this information is correct (*Hint*: it is not!). 

*Note that the more complex the task required, the less efficient it will be to delegate data analysis tasks to large language models.*

## Create complex graphs  

Large language models can help create graphs using more complex functions. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Example: **</span>:

> **Prompt (ChatGPT 5.2)**: I would like to create a column chart representing the results of this growth accounting decomposition of UK labour productivity between 1954 and 2023. I want the graph to stack the contribution of capital accumulation (βgk) and TFP growth (g) in 4 different bars corresponding to the 4 subperiods. See data attached.

```{r CGPT5.2_chart_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", out.height="40%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_chart_data.png"))

```

ChatGPT 5.2 generates:

```{r CGPT5.2_chart1, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_chart_1.png"))

```

```{r CGPT5.2_chart2, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_chart_2.png"))

```

```{r CGPT5.2_chart3, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CGPT5.2_chart_3.png"))

```

<span style="color: blue;">**Check**</span> that the instructions allow you to construct the desired chart.

*Note how important it is to describe precisely what you are trying to achieve and therefore to understand the data and the methodology!*
